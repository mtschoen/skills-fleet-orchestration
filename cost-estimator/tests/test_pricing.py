"""Unit tests for scripts/pricing.py's unpriced_usage() guardrail.

model_family() returns None for any model id it doesn't recognize, and
cost_for_turn() then silently returns $0.00 for that turn -- a new model
family would otherwise undercount every retrospective report with no
warning anywhere in the pipeline. unpriced_usage() is the pure helper
analyze-month.py uses to detect and tally that gap.
